# Spring-Boot-Beginners-Projects
Hands-on repository for learning full-stack development with Spring Boot, JPA, and modern frontends. This repo tracks my progress as I implement projects from EmbarkX's "6 Spring Boot Projects" YouTube tutorial, covering concepts from basic CRUD to Spring AI integration. My coding journey in action.
